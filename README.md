## What is it?
Unity Vehicle Simulator is a driving simulator that replicates realistic driving manners using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features. The simulation's ADAS features body collision detection and avoidance that can help improve a player's performance over the course of playing. The player's improvement in the simulation will help their performance in real life.

### What makes our approach different?
Our approach focuses on two main aspects:
1. Realism
    * We're aiming to create a vehicle simulator that's as realistic as we can possible make it, in terms of functionality of the vehicle and traffic/AI. 
2. Original Assets
    * We're also aiming to create as much of the simulator using our own original 3D objects and textures. 
## Controls
