## What is it?
Unity Vehicle Simulator is a driving simulator that replicates realistic driving manners using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features. The simulation's ADAS features body collision detection and avoidance that can help improve a player's performance over the course of playing. The player's improvement in the simulation will help their performance in real life.

### What makes our approach different?
It's not mario kart, nor a Arm Shopping Cart Simulator.
## Controls
By the end of Winter Term 2023, we only have a WASD driving feature that doesn't really replicate real life driving.
The next term our goal is to feature a controller feature with a steering wheel, pedals and a gear shifter. Our goal is to simulate real life driving to help improve the ADAS feature for real cars.

## Problem
The problems associated to our project is related to ADAS real life features to help assist accident prevention measures.
