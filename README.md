## What is it?
Unity Vehicle Simulator is a driving simulator that replicates realistic driving manners using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features. The simulation's ADAS features body collision detection and avoidance that can help improve a player's performance over the course of playing. The player's improvement in the simulation will help their performance in real life.

### What makes our approach different?
It's not mario kart, nor a Arm Shopping Cart Simulator.
